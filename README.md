Fiction Web App
========================

A website where writing is a collaborative experience and writers build off of each other. Inspiration for your story can come from many places, often from other works. Why not take advantage of that? This website allows users to upload stories and other content of their fictional world, allowing others to be inspired and extend any part. 

Like a character or location in another user's world or story? Great! Use it in your own (extend/branch it) with a reference back to the original. In this way, all content on the site can be thought of as a giant tree, branching off into new worlds and ideas. What started off as a fantasy story can end up a horror story set in the same world with characters from yet another user's world.

Writing should be shared experience. Ideas should be shared,  and characters and events tweaked into similar yet new situations. This site aims to achieve that goal.

### Development
--------------------------------

This site is developed with the Symfony PHP web framework.
